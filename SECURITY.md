## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in making our project more secure.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to the project maintainers via private communication
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/mdastpak/otp-service/security/advisories) feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact the project maintainers directly through their GitHub profiles

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish by exploiting this vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include proof-of-concept code or screenshots
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions of the software are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within **48 hours** and aim to:

- Provide an initial assessment within **5 business days**
- Keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation
- Notify you when the vulnerability is fixed
- Credit you appropriately (if desired) when we announce the fix

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying the OTP Service, follow these security best practices:

#### Environment Configuration
- **Never commit secrets**: Keep API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data out of version control
- **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
- **Secure Redis**: Configure Redis with authentication and network restrictions
- **TLS/HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments

#### Network Security
- **Firewall rules**: Restrict network access to only necessary ports and IPs
- **VPC/Private networks**: Deploy in private networks when possible
- **Rate limiting**: Configure appropriate rate limits to prevent abuse
- **Load balancing**: Use load balancers with proper health checks

#### Monitoring
- **Log monitoring**: Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- **Metrics tracking**: Track OTP generation and verification patterns
- **Alert systems**: Set up alerts for unusual behavior or errors
- **Regular audits**: Perform regular security audits

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize input parameters
- **Error handling**: Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information
- **Dependency updates**: Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions
- **Code reviews**: Conduct thorough security-focused code reviews

#### Testing
- **Security testing**: Include security tests in your test suites
- **Penetration testing**: Perform regular penetration testing
- **Dependency scanning**: Use tools to scan for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static analysis**: Use static code analysis tools for security issues

## Current Security Measures

The OTP Service implements the following security measures:

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all input parameters
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers including HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **UUID Generation**: Cryptographically secure UUID generation
- **OTP Generation**: Secure random OTP generation with configurable parameters

### Infrastructure Security
- **Redis Security**: Support for Redis authentication and secure connections
- **Connection Pooling**: Secure connection pooling with timeout configurations
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- **Logging**: Security-conscious logging that doesn't log sensitive data

### Dependency Management
- **Regular Updates**: Proactive monitoring and updating of dependencies
- **Security Scanning**: Regular scanning for known vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Using only necessary dependencies to reduce attack surface
